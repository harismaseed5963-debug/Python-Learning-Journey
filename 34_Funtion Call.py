# What is Function Call?
# Function Call is the process of executing a function that has been defined earlier.
# When a function is called, the program control is transferred to the function's code block,
# and the code inside the function is executed.
# Function Call:
def greet(name="Haris"):# Function Definition
    print('Hello ',name)# Function Body
greet()# Function Call
